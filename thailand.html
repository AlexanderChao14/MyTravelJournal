                    eaten with a lot of vegitable, creating a spicy and savoury dish that is a must have to eat in Thailand.

                        This market is taken place at a train stations and some of the vendor stalls are 
                        on some train tracks. They sell a lot of items like clothes, souvenirs and many more!
                        And there is so much food during the night market, its basically a whole different place during this time.
