                        Cheese burger is one of America's staple food. And there is a lot of places to get them from. And their is many different 
                        style you can get them too. One of my favorite place I like to get is from In and Out which is an American chain and is in 
                        Los Angeles.

                    <p>
                        Disneyland Park is a place you should try at least once. If your a fan of the Disney movie then you should go check this place out.
                        There is a lot of Disney attraction and rides to do over there. Which makes you feel like your actually in a Disney movie.

                    <p>
                        This place you should go at least once when your in Los Angeles. Their is a lot of sight seeing in this area and many souvenirs that you can get.
                        The boulevard has a lot of plaque of many famous actors, actress, director and movie people.
